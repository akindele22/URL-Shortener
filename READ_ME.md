This app is built with a MVC pattern
It is the building of an app that can shorten url, the user will pass a URL they want to shorten the API will take the URL and generate a random aliasfor it and store them both in the database.

When the user calls the API passing that alias as a parameter, the API will find the matching URL in the database and redirect the user to that URL.
